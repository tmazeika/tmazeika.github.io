This exists because I made a LinkedIn post that links to
https://mazeika.me/2021/11/30/react-hooks-useform.html, but I changed the
site structure, so this page redirects to the new post location at
/blog/react-hooks-useform.html. LinkedIn won't let me change the link and GitHub
Pages doesn't have server-side redirects... :(
