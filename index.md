title: About
---

I'm TJ Mazeika. I'm a computer science student at Northeastern University living in Boston, MA. I currently run a freelancing business called [FoldLeft](https://www.foldleft.dev/) that specializes in web development.

I started programming when I was 12 years old. Like many of my friends at the time, I was obsessed with Minecraft. But, I grew tired of mining and placing blocks. I wanted to change the rules of the game, and so began my journey into CraftBukkit plugin development. Over the course of a couple of months, I taught myself Java and became heavily involved in the Minecraft developer community. Eventually, I was accepted to volunteer as a moderator for plugin submissions to [dev.bukkit.org](https://dev.bukkit.org/). I credit my early growth as a programmer to the amazing mentors in that community who I met along the way.

Throughout high school, I shifted my focus to web development and hobby electronics. My goal during that time was to build personal projects as practice and for fun. That work also solidified my passion for computer science as a profession, which led me to apply as a computer science major at Northeastern University. Since then, I've held a couple of engineering co-op positions and started my own freelancing business. I love building from scratch while using new technologies and participating in fast-paced environments. To that end, I prefer working in smaller teams and early stage startups.
